# schedulizer-bot
Discord bot that maintains a depth-chart of your raid team, receives scheduling updates from raid members, and generates a weekly run-down of roles and responsibilities based on player preferences and optimal raid configurations, minimizing the need for last-minute role changes and PUGs.
